Passwordless Authentication Process:
1. First we have to create a two EC2 instances 
a) ansible-server 
b) target-server

2. In both the server we have to update:
$ sudo apt update  (both the servers)

3. make a directory :
$ mkdir ansible

4. Install the ansible in the both the server:
$ sudo apt install ansible (both the servers)

5. To generate an SSH key pair, you typically run 
$ ssh-keygen (after that it will gives us directory location where the public private SSH key will be stored)

6. list the file 
$ ls /home/ubuntu/.ssh/

7. Go to the .ssh directory
$ cd /home/ubuntu/.ssh/

8. for getting the public ssh key
$ cat id_rsa.pub

* you will get the keys copy that and past it into the target server authorized_keys 


---------- Go to the target server---------
1. To generate an SSH key pair, you typically run 
$ ssh-keygen (after that it will gives us directory location where the public private SSH key will be stored)

2. list the file 
$ ls /home/ubuntu/.ssh/

3. Go to the .ssh directory
$ cd /home/ubuntu/.ssh/

4. For editing and paste the  keys
$ vim authorized_keys 

paste the keys from the ansible server.
----------------------------------
Now, Go to the ansible-server and 
$ ssh private ip address of the target server
